        BURPEES
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The burpee is a phenomenal exercise. In fact, itâ€™s perhaps the very best bodyweight exercise there is, working a multitude of muscles and getting the heart pumping. Burpees burn lots of fat and calories as well. If you could only ever do one bodyweight exercise for the rest of your life, the burpee might well be your best pick.
